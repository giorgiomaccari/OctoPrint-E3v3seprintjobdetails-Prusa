# OctoPrint-E3v3seprintjobdetails

This Plugin enable the communication with [the modified firmware of the Ender 3V3SE](https://github.com/navaismo/Ender-3V3-SE/tree/main) and Octoprint to Render in the Printer's LCD the current print JOB.

- For this was created a custom Command O9000 to send and update the job details.
- Added support for CURA and Orca Files.
- Added support for Direct print from Orca or Cura Slicers.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/navaismo/OctoPrint-E3v3seprintjobdetails/archive/main.zip

## Dependiencies

To work correctly this plugin depends on the below 3rd party plugins:

- Dashboard.
- GcodeViewer.
- PrintTimeGenius.

<br>


## Selection between O9000 and M117 commands.
Since some users has already plugins that send M117 commands to the printer, I've updated the Octoprint plugin to select which messages to reflect in the LCD and avoid overlapping in the screen.
If you want to see the DisplayLayerProgress messages or any other plugin that already sent info to the LCD just keep the seecto disabled.
If you want to see the Jobs details in the LCD enable the selector to send only the O9000 commands from Octoprint.

## Also you can choose between Time based Progress, Layer based Progress or M73 command Progress to see in the LCD.

## Fine tunning for canceling and pausing/resuming jobs
To have a better controel of messages and printer moves you may want to add this block codes to the GCODE SCRIPTS section of Octoprint settings:


### After print Job is Cancelled 
```C
; relative moving
G91
; move head 10mm up
G1 Z10 F800
; absolute moving
G90

; move print head out of the way
G1 X0 Y220 F3000

; disable motors
M84

; disable all heaters
{% snippet 'disable_hotends' %}
M104 S0 ; Set Hotend to 0

{% snippet 'disable_bed' %}
M140 S0 ; Set Bed to 0

;disable fan
M106 S0

; send message to printer.
M117 Print was cancelled
```

### After print Job is Paused 
```C
{% if pause_position.x is not none %}
; relative XYZE
G91
M83

; retract filament of 0.8 mm up, move Z slightly upwards and 
G1 Z+5 E-0.8 F4500

; absolute XYZE
M82
G90

; move to a safe rest position, adjust as necessary
G1 X0 Y220
{% endif %}
```

### Before print Job is Resumed 
```C
{% if pause_position.x is not none %}
; relative extruder
M83

; prime nozzle
G1 E-0.8 F4500
G1 E0.8 F4500
G1 E0.8 F4500

; absolute E
M82

; absolute XYZ
G90

; reset E
G92 E{{ pause_position.e }}

; WARNING!!! - use M83 or M82(extruder absolute mode) according what your slicer generates
M83 ; extruder relative mode

; move back to pause position XYZ
G1 X{{ pause_position.x }} Y{{ pause_position.y }} Z{{ pause_position.z }} F4500

; reset to feed rate before pause if available
{% if pause_position.f is not none %}G1 F{{ pause_position.f }}{% endif %}
{% endif %}
```


## If using Firmware >= [V1.0.9.7_4.b](https://github.com/navaismo/Ender-3V3-SE/releases/tag/V1.0.9.7_4.b) set the following in GCODE script section:

## Issues?
If you have issues open an Issue or a discussion. Sending the following information:

- Version of Plugin and Firmware.
- Describe what happened.
- How the Gcode file was loaded.
- Was from GUI or Slicer.
- If your Gcode is not parsed correctly, attach your gcode file, currently only Orca and Cura files has been tested.
- Add an Image.
